Phantom cats, also known as Alien Big Cats (ABCs), are large felines, such as jaguars, cougars, and panthers which have been purported to appear in regions outside their indigenous range. Sightings, tracks and predation have been reported in a number of countries and states including Britain, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Finland, Denmark, Eastern United States, Hawaii, Italy and Luxembourg.
As with other aspects of cryptozoology, the study of Phantom Cats is considered by mainstream science to constitute pseudoscience or fringe science. In general, scientists reject the possibility that such mega-fauna cryptids exist, because of the improbably large numbers necessary to maintain a breeding population[1] and because climate and food supply issues make their survival in reported habitats unlikely.[2]

Britain[edit]
Main article: British big cats
Since the 1960s, there have been many sightings of big cats across Great Britain.[3] A 15-month survey conducted in 2003-2004 by the British Big Cats Society gave the following regional breakdown, based on 2052 sightings: South West 21%, South East 16%, East Anglia 12%, Scotland 11%, and West Midlands 9%.[4]
Australia[edit]
See also: Cats in Australia
Sightings of exotic big cats in Australia began more than 100 years ago. The New South Wales State Government reported in 2003 that it was "more likely than not" that there was a colony of exotic big cats living in the bush near Sydney.[5][6]
Gippsland phantom cat[edit]
Main article: Gippsland phantom cat
In the Gippsland region of south-eastern Victoria, the origin of the cats is claimed[who?] to be American World War II airmen who brought cougars with them as mascots and released them in the Australian Bush.[7] Photographic evidence is often difficult to interpret.[who?]
Grampians puma[edit]
A study by Deakin University concluded that a big cat population in the Grampian mountains range is "beyond reasonable doubt".[8]
Blue Mountains Panther[edit]
Main article: Blue Mountains Panther
The Blue Mountains Panther is a phantom cat reported in sightings in the Blue Mountains area, west of Sydney, New South Wales for over a century. Speculation about the Blue Mountains Panther includes the theory that it is descended from either circus or zoo escapees, or is a descendant of a military mascot.
Video footage showing a large black cat near Lithgow was examined by a group of seven zoo, museum, parks and agriculture staff, who concluded that it was a large domestic cat (2–3 times normal size) based partly on its morphology and partly on the behaviour of a nearby normal-sized domestic cat.[6]
Tantanoola Tiger[edit]
The region around Tantanoola, a town in the south-east of South Australia was supposed to have been the stalking ground of The Tantanoola Tiger during the late nineteenth century. In 1895 an animal believed to be the Tantanoola Tiger was shot and identified as an Assyrian wolf. It was stuffed and remains on display in the Tantanoola Hotel.[9][10]
Sunshine Coast big cats[edit]
There have been some claims that "Big Cats" have stalked the hinterland of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland since early in the 19th century.[11][12] These claims have been met with skepticism.[12]
Denmark[edit]
In 1995, a big cat usually described as a lion (but sometimes as a lynx) was dubbed the "Beast of Funen" by numerous eye-witnesses.[13] There was an earlier big cat sighting from 1982 in southern Jutland.[13]
The Netherlands[edit]
In 2005 a black cougar was allegedly spotted on several occasions in a wildlife preserve,[14][dead link] but the animal, nicknamed Winnie, was later identified as an unusually large crossbreed between a domestic and a wild cat.[15]
New Zealand[edit]
See also: Cats in New Zealand
Since the late 1990s, big cat sightings have been reported in widely separated parts of New Zealand, in both the North[16] and South Islands.[17] There have been several unverified panther sightings in Mid-Canterbury near Ashburton and in the nearby foothills of the Southern Alps,[18][19][20] but searches conducted there in 2003 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry found no corroborating physical evidence.[16]
United States[edit]
California[edit]
Phantom black "panthers" have been reported across the state, and are seen with particular frequency at and around Mount Diablo, in Contra Costa County, California.[21]
Hawaii[edit]
Stories of "mystery big cats" on the island of Maui have been circulating since the late 1980s.[citation needed] In December 2002, sightings of a big cat increased in number in the Kula (upcountry) area, and the Division of Forestry and Wildlife requested the help of big cat wildlife biologists William Van Pelt and Stan Cunningham of the Arizona Game and Fish Department. Van Pelt and Cunningham believed the cat was probably a large feline, such as a jaguar, leopard, or cougar.[22][23] It may have been illegally brought into Hawaii as a pet and released or allowed to wander in the wild. No big cat was detected by traps, infrared cameras, or professional trackers. A fur sample was obtained in 2003 but DNA analysis was inconclusive. The state's hunt for the cat was suspended in late November 2003, after three weeks without sightings.[24] Utah State University professor and wildlife biologist Robert Schmidt expressed strong doubts about the cat's existence, likening it to the Loch Ness monster.[25]
Mississippi[edit]
"Black panther" sightings have been reported in many rural areas of Mississippi. The existence of the Mississippi panther is accepted by many natives, even though there has never been any scientific proof to support this belief. The state's proximity to the habitat of the Florida panther is sometimes given as evidence that cougars could also exist in Mississippi. Opponents to the theory deny the existence of the panthers or claim that witnesses are simply misidentifying the native lynxes or bobcats.
Texas[edit]
East Texans living in the rural community of Deadwood in Panola County have reported for years seeing black panthers and mountain lions. In October 2010, Panola County newspaper The Panola Watchman published a photo from a game camera showing an adult mountain lion. Soon other newspapers across the state published the photo including the Austin American-Statesman.
Delaware[edit]
There have been reported sightings of what is believed to be a mountain lion in the northern Delaware forests since the late 1990s. It is believed that the creature lives somewhere in the Pike Creek or White Clay Creek area, as this is where the majority of the numerous sightings have occurred. The Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife believes there may be more than one mountain lion in Delaware, and that they originate from animals released from captivity.[26]
Pennsylvania[edit]
In the Summer months of 2010 a very large cat was spotted in Cheltenham Township, Montgomery County. The cat was reported to be the size of a Labrador retriever, but had markings similar to a bobcat. Although the cat was photographed, the photos no longer exist, so a positive identification cannot be made. Eerie howls have been heard in the area, but there have been no other sightings.[citation needed]
Luxembourg[edit]
In 2009, a black panther was allegedly spotted in the industrial area of Bommelscheuer near Bascharage.[27] When police came, the panther was gone. In the following couple of days, the panther was spotted all over the country. For a while it was alleged that a panther had escaped a nearby zoo (Amnéville), but the zoo later denied that any panther was missing. A couple of days after the Bascharage incident, it also was mentioned that although the police did not find a panther, they did find an unusually large housecat.[28]
India[edit]
Main article: Pogeyan
The Pogeyan is a large grey feline known to local people living in the Western Ghats, India. The name "Pogeyan" is derived from the local dialect and means "The cat that comes and goes like the mist."
