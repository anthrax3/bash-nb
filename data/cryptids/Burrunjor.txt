				The following is a list of cryptids and alleged relicts, which are animals and plants studied under the field of cryptozoology. Their presumptive existence has often been derived from anecdotal or other evidence, considered insufficient by mainstream science.
Every animal or plant on this page is marked as one of the following:

Unconfirmed – cryptids whose existence is alleged but not demonstrated.
Disputed; [explanation] – cryptids that have a body of evidence against their existence.
Proposed [animal name] – cryptids with an alternative explanation accepted by the general scientific community.
Extinct – animals that are generally believed to be extinct, but which cryptozoologists believe may have an extant relict population.

Animals no longer considered cryptids are marked:

Confirmed [animal name or cause] – animals once classified as cryptids but whose existence has now been confirmed.
Hoax – cryptids once thought to be real but later conclusively proven to be hoaxes.

Notes[edit]


^ The High-finned sperm whale is a supposed relative of the sperm whale that is said to live in the seas around Shetland. The difference between this creature and other sperm whales is said to be the presence of a tall dorsal fin on its back, which the sperm whale lacks. Two such stranded whales were apparently observed by Sir Robert Sibbald who described their dorsal fins as being similar to a "mizzen mast".[9]
