A cougar, to which the onza is said to be similar


The Onza is claimed to be a feline species similar to a cougar. It is a cryptid – a creature whose existence has been claimed but not proved. The term has also been used to refer to the jaguarundi (Puma yaguaroundi).
In 1938, and again in 1986, cougar-like animals shot in Sinaloa were identified as onzas.[citation needed] The only viable specimen to have been examined was contributed by a rancher named Andres Murillo. In January 1986, he shot what he thought was a jaguar attacking him. It proved not to be a jaguar, and he brought it to Vega, who owned a nearby ranch. It was a female weighing 60 lb (27 kg). The body excluding the tail was 45 inches (1.1 m) long, and the tail was 23 inches (58 cm). The cat had the appearance of a cougar with a very long, thin body and long, thin dog-like legs. Deer had been found in its stomach, indicating that it had eaten recently. Vega told Murillo that the specimen greatly resembled the onza his father had shot in the 1970s, the skull of which he still had.[citation needed] These animals were much like cougars but had lighter frames with longer, striped legs, longer ears, and a longer tail.
Researchers from Texas Tech University examined a frozen onza corpse in the 1990s and concluded that it was most likely a genetic variant of the cougar, but not a distinct species.[citation needed] DNA testing has shown that specimen to be a puma, with no significant difference between it and any other puma.[1][clarification needed (cougar or the genus?)]
A legend less well known among cryptozoologists states that there are two species of jaguarundi living in Mexico, one usually called "onza" and the other called by other local names.[1]

Name[edit]
The Spanish name onza derives from the Latin lynx, lyncis, and is equivalent to the English word "ounce", originally applied to the lynx but now more commonly to the snow leopard (Uncia uncia).[2] There are old texts written by Spanish conquistadors about the onza, but they might refer to the jaguarundi, which is known as onza in many Mexican states.[1] Onça is the Portuguese word for jaguar, Panthera onca, where a spotted jaguar is known as onça-pintada and a melanistic one as onça-preta. These are real animals, occurring as far north as Mexico and possibly into the southwest of the United States. Also, the puma Puma concolor is known most often as onça-parda in some areas of Brazil (in others, it is known by the name that predates American cougar, suçuarana). The onza is also known as "cuitlamiztili".
History[edit]
A Mexican feline identified as an onza by cryptozoologists first appears in Aztec texts. Volume 13 of the Florentine Codex, a compilation of Aztec customs, beliefs and natural history, describes the cuitlamiztli, which it says to resemble a cougar but to be far more aggressive. Christopher Columbus sent a letter from Mexico to the Spanish kings, describing a remarkable animal: "A marksman killed a beast like a cat, but pretty much longer and with a human-like face. He pierced it with an arrow ... Nevertheless, it was so wild that he had to cut a foreleg and a rear leg from it. When a boar saw the beast, it got the creeps ... In spite of that, the huge cat was dying ... It immediately attacked the boar, surrounded his snout with his tail and strongly pressed it. Then with the foreleg that was left, it strangled it." When the conquistadores arrived in Mexico from Spain, they were shown the great zoo of the emperor Montezuma. One of the Spaniards, Bernal Díaz del Castillo, said that the zoo contained "tigers (jaguars) and lions (cougars) of two kinds, one of which resembled the wolf".[citation needed]
After the Spaniards settled in Mexico, the animal was seen more often, and they gave it the name onza. "It is not as timid as the [cougar]", wrote a Jesuit priest, Father Ignaz Pfefferkorn, in 1757, "and he who ventures to attack it must be well on his guard".[citation needed] Another missionary, Father Johann Baegert, wrote that an "onza dared to invade my neighbor's mission when I was visiting, and attacked a 14-year-old boy in broad daylight ... A few years ago another killed the strongest and most respected soldier" in the area.[citation needed]
It is very likely that mentions of the onza in Spanish documents from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries refer, not to any cryptid animal, or even to the feline known as onza in 20th-century Sinaloa as most cryptozoologists think, but to the well-known jaguarundi. Ordinary jaguarundis are called onza in most Mexican states.[1]
Twentieth century[edit]
In 1938, hunters Dale and Clell Lee, with Indiana banker Joseph Shirk, shot what locals identified as an onza near La Silla Mountain in Sinaloa. Dale Lee was certain that the animal they shot was not a puma.[clarification needed (cougar or the genus?)] Although somewhat resembling a puma in coloration, its ears, legs, and body were much longer, and it was built more lightly than a puma.[citation needed]
In January 1986, Mexican farmer Andres Murillo, who owned a ranch in the San Ignacio District of Sinaloa, killed an animal similar to the one shot by the Lee brothers. Rodriguez and Ricardo Zamora were deer hunting at about 10:30 p.m. when they came across a large cat which seemed ready to charge. Fearing a jaguar attack, Rodriguez shot it. Seeing that it was not a jaguar or a puma, they took the body back to Rodriguez's ranch, and Rodriguez contacted a Mr. Vega, who owned a nearby ranch and was an experienced hunter. Vega said that the cat was an onza and that it was nearly identical to one that his father had shot in the 1970s (the skull of the Vega animal had been preserved). Vega in turn contacted Ricardo Urquijo, Jr., who suggested taking the animal's body to Mazatlán for examination.
The cat was found to have a large wound on one of the rear legs, which both Rodriguez and Vega believed to have been inflicted by a jaguar. It was also found to have been in good health, with a fully functional reproductive system.
Identity[edit]
Most cryptozoologists felt that the onza represented a new subspecies of cougar, or possibly an entirely new species of cat.[citation needed] German mammalogist Helmut Hemmer even suggested that it was an extant specimen of the prehistoric American cheetah (Miracinonyx trumani).[citation needed] After examining American cheetah skulls, however, J. Richard Greenwell of the International Society for Cryptozoology (ISC) concluded by 1986 that the onza was not to be identified with it.[citation needed]
A further problem is the fact that in Mexico the term onza refers to more than one species. DNA testing confirmed that the Sinaloa specimen was a well-known subspecies of cougar and not an American cheetah or an unknown species.[1] In other Mexican states the jaguarundi is also referred to as onza. Furthermore, there are also local legends claiming that there are two species of jaguarundi, one of which is usually called onza.[1]
