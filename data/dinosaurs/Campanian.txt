Subdivision of the Cretaceous system
according to the IUGS, as of July 2012.


The Campanian is, in the ICS' geologic timescale, the fifth of six ages of the Late Cretaceous epoch (or, in chronostratigraphy: the fifth of six stages in the Upper Cretaceous series). The Campanian spans the time from 83.6 ± 0.7 Ma to 72.1 ± 0.6 Ma (million years ago). It is preceded by the Santonian and it is followed by the Maastrichtian.[1]

Stratigraphic definition[edit source | edit]
The Campanian was introduced in scientific literature by Henri Coquand in 1857. It is named after the French village of Champagne in the département Charente-Maritime. The original type locality was an outcrop near the village of Aubeterre-sur-Dronne in the same region. Due to changes of the stratigraphic definitions, this section is now part of the Maastrichtian stage.
The base of the Campanian stage is laid at the extinction of crinoid species Marsupites testudinarius. A GSSP had not yet been ratified in 2009. One possible candidate is in a section near a dam at Waxahachie, Texas.
The top of the Campanian is defined as the place in the stratigraphic column were the ammonite Pachydiscus neubergicus first appears.
Subdivision[edit source | edit]
The Campanian is sometimes subdivided into Lower, Middle and Upper subages. In the Tethys domain, the Campanian encompasses six ammonite biozones. They are, from young to old:

zone of Nostoceras hyatti
zone of Didymoceras chayennense
zone of Bostrychoceras polyplocum
zone of Hoplitoplacenticeras marroti/Hoplitoplacenticeras vari
zone of Delawarella delawarensis
zone of Placenticeras bidorsatum

Paleontology[edit source | edit]
During the Campanian age, a radiation among dinosaur species occurred. In North America, for example, the number of known dinosaur genera rises from 4 at the base of the Campanian to 48 in the upper part. This development is sometimes referred to as the "Campanian Explosion". However, it is not yet clear if the event is artificial, i.e. the low number of genera in the lower Campanian can be caused by a lower preservation chance for fossils in deposits of that age. The generally warm climates and large continental area covered in shallow sea during the Campanian probably favoured the dinosaurs. In the following Maastrichtian stage, the number of North American dinosaur genera found is 30% less than in the upper Campanian.[2]
Animals that lived in the Campanian include:

Aralosaurus


Asia
Aralosaurus was about the size of an elephant. Although very little is known about Aralosaurus (only one near complete skull has been found); it was identified by a beak with nearly 1,000 small teeth in 30 rows. These teeth were used for breaking up plant matter by chewing, a feature common in herbivorous dinosaurs, but unusual for reptiles.The back of an Aralosaurus skull was wide, a feature suggestive of large jaw muscles used to power its chewing apparatus.

Brachylophosaurus


Montana, USA; Alberta, Canada
Brachylophosaurus was a typical hadrosaur which reached an adult length of 9 meters (30 ft).



Corythosaurus


Alberta, Canada
Corythosaurus weighed in at 4 tonnes and measured roughly 10 metres (33 ft) from nose to tail. Like other hadrosaurs it had a toothless beak, the back of the jaws contained a dental battery composed of hundreds of small, interlocking teeth. These were used to crush and grind plant matter and were continually replaced as they wore away.



Diclonius


Montana, USA




Edmontosaurus


Canada
Edmontosaurus included some of the largest hadrosaurid species, measuring up to 12 metres (39 ft) long and weighing around 4.0 metric tons (4.4 short tons).



Gasparinisaura


Argentina
Gasparinisaura was a small bipedal herbivore. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated the length at 1.7 metres, the weight at thirteen kilogrammes.



Gilmoreosaurus


Mongolia




Gryposaurus


Alberta, Canada
Gryposaurus was a hadrosaurid of typical size and shape.



Hadrosaurus


New Jersey, USA
It was likely bipedal for the purposes of running, but could use its forelegs to support itself while feeding.



Hypacrosaurus


Alberta, Canada
Hypacrosaurus is most easily distinguished from other hollow-crested duckbills by its tall neural spines and the form of its crest. The neural spines, which project from the top of the vertebrae, are 5 to 7 times the height of the body of their respective vertebrae in the back,[4] which would have given it a tall back in profile. The skull's hollow crest is like that of Corythosaurus, but is more pointed along its top, not as tall, wider side to side, and has a small bony point at the rear



Hypsibema


North Carolina and Missouri, USA




Kritosaurus


North America
The type specimen of Kritosaurus navajovius is only represented by a partial skull and lower jaws, and associated postcranial remains.



Lambeosaurus


Alberta, Canada




Lophorhothon


Alabama, USA




Maiasaura


Montana, USA
Maiasaura was large, attaining an adult length of about 9 metres (30 ft) and had the typical hadrosaurid flat beak and a thick nose. It had a small, spiky crest in front of its eyes. The crest may have been used in headbutting contests between males during the breeding season.



Mandschurosaurus


Asia




Microhadrosaurus


China




Mochlodon


Austria
A rhabdodontid



Naashoibitosaurus


New Mexico, USA
Naashoibitosaurus, based as it is on a single partial skeleton, is not well known in terms of anatomy. Its skull, the most thoroughly described portion, has a low nasal crest that peaks in front of the eyes, but does not strongly arch as in Gryposaurus.



Nipponosaurus


Russia




Orodromeus


Montana, USA
Orodromeus was a small fast bipedal herbivore that probably coexisted with dinosaurs such as Daspletosaurus and Einiosaurus. Its length was estimated by Horner & Weishampel at 2.5 metres.



Parasaurolophus


Alberta, Canada; New Mexico and Utah, USA




Prosaurolophus


Alberta, Canada
Prosaurolophus was a large-headed duckbill; the most complete described specimen has a skull around 0.9 meters long (2.9 ft) on a ~8.5 meter long skeleton (~28 ft).[2] It had a small, stout, triangular crest in front of the eyes; the sides of this crest were concave, forming depressions. The upper arm was relatively short.



Pteropelyx


Montana, USA




Rhabdodon


France; Spain; Haţeg Island, Romania
It is unclear whether it was an iguanodont or a hypsilophodont, and may be a "missing link" between the two. Current evidence indicates it is an iguanodont similar to Tenontosaurus.



Saurolophus


North America, Asia
Saurolophus is known from material including nearly complete skeletons, giving researchers a clear picture of its bony anatomy. S. osborni, the rarer Albertan species, was around 9.8 meters long (32 feet), with its skull a meter long (3.3 feet). Its weight is estimated at 1.9 tonnes (2.1 tons). S. angustirostris, the Mongolian species, was larger; the type skeleton is roughly 12 meters long (39.4 ft), and larger remains are reported.



Shantungosaurus


China
It is one of the longest and largest known hadrosaurids; the composite skeleton of a medium-sized individual mounted at the Geological Institute of China in Beijing measures 14.72 metres (48.3 ft) in length
